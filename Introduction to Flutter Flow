4. **Real-Time Preview:** See changes in real-time as you build.
5. **Exportable Code:** Export clean Flutter code for full control or to continue development in your own IDE.
6. **Team Collaboration:** Share projects and work with team members directly within FlutterFlow.
7. **Built-In Components:** Includes a library of widgets and pre-made templates to speed up development.

### **Use Cases:**

* Rapid prototyping and MVP development
* Building full production apps for iOS, Android, and web
